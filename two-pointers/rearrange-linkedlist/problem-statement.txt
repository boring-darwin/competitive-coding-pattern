Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to modify the LinkedList such that the nodes from 
the second half of the LinkedList are inserted alternately to the nodes from the first half in
reverse order. So if the LinkedList has nodes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null, 
your method should return 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> null.
